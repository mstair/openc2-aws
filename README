Notes
==========================
* GCP/Azure fws are stateful
* Rule names are defined as openc2+uuid.uuid4()
* Command events are published to /openc2/event/slpf/command/$requestid topic
* Response events are published to /openc2/event/slpf/response/$requestid topic

TODOs
==========================
* AWS security groups. Stateful/allow only. Require ip_net/connection target to delete
